# ch - 8 What is JSON & JSON Parsing ?


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and web applications as text.

### Primary Data Structures:
- Objects: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- Arrays: Ordered lists of values.
- 
## JSON Objects
JSON objects are enclosed in curly braces {} and consist of key-value pairs separated by commas. Each key must be a string enclosed in double quotes ", followed by a colon : and then the corresponding value. Keys must be unique within an object.
Example of a JSON Object:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

## JSON Arrays

JSON arrays are enclosed in square brackets [] and contain an ordered list of values separated by commas. Values can be of any JSON data type, including objects and other arrays.
Example of a JSON array:
```json
[
  "apple",
  "banana",
  "Orange"
]
```
