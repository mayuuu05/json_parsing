## Key Features of JSON

- **Human-readable:** It's easy for people to read and understand.
- **Machine-readable:** Computers can easily parse and process JSON data.
- **Language-independent:** Used by many programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and more.
- **Lightweight:** Efficient to transmit over networks.
- **Data structures:** Supports arrays and objects.

## Basic Structure

JSON data is made up of two primary structures:

1. **Objects:** Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
2. **Arrays:** Ordered lists of values.

## Getting Started
To parse JSON data in Flutter, you need to use the `dart:convert` library, which provides the necessary methods to convert JSON data into Dart objects.

## Example JSON Data
Here is a sample JSON data that we will parse in this example:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "email": "john.doe@example.com",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "zip": "12345"
  }
}
