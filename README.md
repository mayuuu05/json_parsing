# ch - 8 Json and Json parsing

## What is JSON and what are its primary data structures?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and web applications as text.

### Primary Data Structures:
- Objects: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- Arrays: Ordered lists of values.

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "city": "New York"
}
```

Example of a JSON array:
```json
[
  "apple",
  "banana",
  "Orange"
]
```
